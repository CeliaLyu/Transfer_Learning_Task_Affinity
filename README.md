**Xiaoxi Celia Lyu， Weixin He， Ziyan Chen， Zhan Shi**

Final project for ECE685D Introduction to Deep Learning, Duke University, Spring 2022. All authors contributed equally to this work



**Documents Description**
To run main.py, the directory should be set as A3_submit

1. Codes:

   - utils.py defined all the train/test functions for the Neural Network Architecture, and the functions to compute the fisher distance between tasks

   - main.py is for data simulation and all the experiments implementations in this project

   - clean.py is for data cleaning and preparation for weather data   

   - ckpt folders contain all the models trained in this project

2. Data: contains the preprocessed weather data and its description. The original data is too large so we do not submit it, but it is available by request.
3. Ref: contains the reference paper whose methods are mainly applied in this project
4. Tex/Figures: all the figure outputs in this projects
